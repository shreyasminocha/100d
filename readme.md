# 100D Political Model

*Content Warning: Occasional mild profanity*

A web-app full of sliders to precisely represent one's political ideology.

This is a near-replica of [u/DontDoMarmalade](///www.reddit.com/user/DontDoMarmalade)'s [axis chart](//www.reddit.com/r/Jreg/comments/djd0qx/i_made_an_actual_axis_chart_for_the_100), except interactive.

> Inferior political tests.
>
> The [political compass](//www.politicalcompass.org) and [8values](//8values.github.io) are inferior forms of political discourse. The 100-axis political spectrum is acceptable.
